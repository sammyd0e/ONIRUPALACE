        There are two leading traditional issues trailing the <span class="font-semibold text-[#f2f2f2]">Idejo chiefs of Lagos</span>, namely:
        how many are they, and how many have successfully transmuted to traditional suzerain with political power over a kingdom?
        The first question has seen very political and judicial responses about social relationships involving people, authority, and power.
      </p>

      <p className="text-white">
        Depending on the objective, the number of the Idejo chiefs have been given variously as <span class="italic">11, 16, and even 32</span>.
        However, the number that is relatively free from distortions and political or personal insertion is <span class="font-semibold">11</span>.
        Thus, the Idejo chiefs are historically believed to be the direct sons of <span class="font-semibold">Olofin Iddo</span>, who moved in the throes of migrations
        from Iddo to their present kingdoms or chiefdoms, depending on their current traditional political statuses.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Idejos, eleven in number, have enjoyed substantial acceptance with near practicable measure of refutation.
        Various judicial panels and boards of enquiry have affirmed this position, and this has been registered in folklores and social music—
        most popular of which was serenaded by <span class="font-semibold">Lefty Salami</span> titled
        <em class="text-[#0d3b66]">"Oloye Mokanla."</em>

        The Eleven Idejo Chiefs
      </h2>
      <p>
        The eleven Idejo chiefs are:
        <span class="font-medium">Aromire, Olumegbon, Onikoyi, Onitano, Ojora, Oluwa, Onisowo, Onitolo, Oloto, Oniru,</span>
        and <span class="font-medium">Elegushi</span>.

        Further Transformations
      </h2>
      <p>
        The other issue is that of change in the traditional stead of Idejo title holders,
        reflecting ongoing evolution within Lagos’ socio-political and cultural landscape.
